RetroPie Splashscreen Randomizer
====================

Very very simple script to randomize splashscreens for your retropie.


It will work *only* with:

RetroPie SD Image 2.3 do not try use it with older versions paths may be different.


Usage
====================

* Setup
*git pull https://github.com/sur0x/retropiesplashscreen.git*
*sudo ./setup_splash.sh*

* Script
*git pull https://github.com/sur0x/retropiesplashscreen.git*
*sudo ./splashscreen.sh*

Setup Options
====================

* Option 1:

It will install the splashscreen.sh to your init.d and make it run @ boot time using update-rc.d, so you will get a new splashscreen everytime that you boot.

* Option 2:

Updates via git pull the folder to get script updates and more images that I'll be adding whenever I find a suitable img, you can send me splashscreens via github or rodrigosiviero at gmail.

* Option 3:

Quits.

Contribution
====================
Please contribute to the splashcreens, if you think a img is suitable fork and pull request or send me via email.
I have added three initial custom splashs that I found on Retropie forums:
