Usage
====================

Setup:
*git clone https://github.com/sur0x/retropiesplashscreen.git*  
*sudo ./setup_splash.sh*

Or

If you don't want to use GIT to update, just download the master.zip, it will be updated with wget if doesn't find a valid repo.


Script: (In case you don't want to install the script on init.d)  
*git clone https://github.com/sur0x/retropiesplashscreen.git*  
*sudo ./splashscreen.sh*

Setup Options
====================

* Option 1:

It will install the splashscreen.sh to your init.d and make it run @ boot time using update-rc.d, so you will get a new splashscreen everytime that you boot.

* Option 2:

Updates via git pull the folder to get script updates and more images that I'll be adding overtime.

* Option 3:

Copy new Splashscreens

* Option 4:

Copy Videos

* Option 5:

Quits.
